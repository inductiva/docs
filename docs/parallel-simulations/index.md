## Get started
🔢 The Parallel Simulations section explains how to run multiple simulations at the same time using Inductiva’s cloud infrastructure. Instead of running one task after another, you’ll learn how to launch several simulations in parallel — saving time and making better use of your computational quota. This guide walks you through batching tasks using Python or the CLI, and provides tips on organizing and monitoring multiple concurrent runs efficiently.

## Why it's Useful
✓ **Save time:** Run dozens of simulations simultaneously instead of waiting for one to finish before starting the next.

✓ **Faster results:** Test more ideas or parameter variations in the same amount of time.

✓ **Scales easily:** Explore how far you can push parallel execution by launching large batches of tasks.

✓ **Boost productivity:** Spend less time waiting and more time analyzing results.

✓ **Reusable structure:** The same logic can be applied across simulators, projects, or tasks.
