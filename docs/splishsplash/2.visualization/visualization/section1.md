After running the 400 simulations in [Generate the Dataset](../../tutorials/synthetic-data-for-piml/sections/section4), it’s time to download and visualize the results.

To simplify the process, we’ve provided a few helper scripts.

## Step 1: Download the Simulation Results
Start by downloading the results from the cloud using the following command:

```bash
inductiva project download splishsplash_400
```

This will create a folder named `inductiva_output` in your current directory, containing the output files from all 400 simulations.

## Step 2: Generate Visualizations
To visualize particle movements from each simulation, we’ve created a Python script that processes the results and generates individual GIFs.

Download the visualization script here:
👉 [Download `splishsplash_gen_viz.py`](https://storage.googleapis.com/inductiva-api-demo-files/splishsplash_gen_viz.py)

### How to Use the Script
1. Place the downloaded `splishsplash_gen_viz.py` file in the same directory as the `inductiva_output` folder.
2. Create a new folder named `gifs` in the same directory to store the generated visualizations.
3. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python splishsplash_gen_viz.py
```

> **Note**: On some systems, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

If any required packages are missing, install them using:

```bash
pip install vtk numpy imageio
```

Once the script finishes, you’ll find a collection of GIFs in the `gifs` folder — one for each simulation. Each animation captures the motion of particles over time, providing a clear visual representation of the simulation dynamics.

Next, we’ll show you how to combine these individual GIFs into a single animation, making it easier to compare simulation results side by side.
