This tutorial builds upon the [Generate Synthetic Data for Physics-Informed ML](../tutorials/synthetic-data-for-piml/) guide.
We pick up from the [Generate the Dataset](../tutorials/synthetic-data-for-piml/sections/section4) section.

We'll start by showing how to convert individual simulation outputs into visually appealing GIFs. Then, we'll demonstrate how 
to combine multiple GIFs into a single animation.
