This tutorial will show you how to run gprMax simulations using the Inductiva API.

We will cover the `Bowtie antenna model` case from the gprMax examples to help you get started with simulations.

This example shows how to use a built-in antenna model in a simulation. Using a realistic antenna, like a MALA 1.2 GHz model, instead of a simple source improves accuracy, especially for near-field targets and complex antenna-environment interactions.

## Prerequisites
Download the required files [here](https://docs.gprMax.com/en/latest/examples_antennas.html) and save them to a folder named `SimulationFiles`. Then, you’ll be ready to send your simulation to the Cloud.

## Running an gprMax Simulation
Here is the code required to run a gprMax simulation using the Inductiva API:

```python
"""gprMax example."""
import inductiva

# Allocate cloud machine on Google Cloud Platform
cloud_machine = inductiva.resources.MachineGroup( \
    provider="GCP",
    machine_type="c2d-highcpu-16")

# Initialize the Simulator
gprMax = inductiva.simulators.GprMax(version="3.1.7")

#  List of commands to run
commands = [
    "python -m gprMax antenna_like_MALA_1200_fs.in",
]

# Run simulation
task = gprMax.run(\
    input_dir="/Path/to/SimulationFiles",
    commands=commands,
    on=cloud_machine)

# Wait for the simulation to finish and download the results
task.wait()
cloud_machine.terminate()

task.download_outputs()
task.print_summary()
```

In this basic example, we're using a cloud machine (`c2d-highcpu-16`) equipped with 16 
virtual CPUs. For larger or more compute-intensive simulations, consider adjusting the `machine_type` parameter to select a machine with more virtual CPUs or one equipped with 
GPUs. You can explore the full range of available machines [here](https://console.inductiva.ai/machine-groups/instance-types).

> **Note**: Setting `spot=True` enables the use of [spot machines](/guides/machines/spot-machines), which are available at substantial discounts.
> However, your simulation may be interrupted if the cloud provider reclaims the machine.

To adapt this script for other gprMax simulations, replace `input_dir` with the path to your gprMax input files and set the `commands` accordingly. Be sure to specify the gprMax version compatible with your input files.

When the simulation is complete, we terminate the machine, download the results
and print a summary of the simulation as shown below.

```

As you can see in the "In Progress" line, the part of the timeline that represents the actual execution of the simulation, the core computation time of this simulation was approximately 3 minutes.
