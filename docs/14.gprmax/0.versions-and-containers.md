## About gprMax
[gprMax](https://www.gprmax.com/index.shtml) is open-source software for simulating electromagnetic wave propagation using Yee’s algorithm and the 3D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. It models Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for applications in engineering, geophysics, archaeology, and medicine—such as assessing infrastructure, locating buried utilities, mapping glaciers, detecting landmines, and identifying tumors.

## Supported Versions
Inductiva stays up to date with the latest versions of gprMax. Below is a list of the supported versions, along with their respective release dates:

- **3.1.7** (Jan., 2024)

To use a specific gprMax version, simply specify it when initializing the simulator:

```python
gprmax = inductiva.simulators.GprMax( \
    version="3.1.7")
```

If you need to use a version not listed here, please feel free to [Contact Us](mailto:support@inductiva.ai).
We’ll be happy to accommodate your request!

## Container Images
Each version of gprMax in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=gprmax), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/gprmax).
