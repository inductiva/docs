## About gprMax
[gprMax](https://www.gprmax.com/index.shtml) is an open-source software 

## Supported Versions

```

If you need to use a version not listed here, please feel free to [Contact Us](mailto:support@inductiva.ai).
We’ll be happy to accommodate your request!

## Container Images
Each version of gprMax in the Inductiva API has its own publicly available container image, 
so you can also use it to run simulations. These images are hosted in our Docker Hub repository, 
[Kutu](https://hub.docker.com/r/inductiva/kutu/tags?name=gprmax), and you can find the 
Dockerfile details for each version [here](https://github.com/inductiva/kutu/tree/main/simulators/gprmax).
