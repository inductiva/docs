How much compute time will 5\$ get you at Inductiva? Well, it can actually get you quite a lot compute time!

💡Consider for example **Inductiva’s top pick machine**, the c2d-highcpu-112.
This 112-core machine with 224GM of RAM can cost you as little as 0.68\$US per hour in spot mode. So, 5\$US will let you use this machine for more than 6 hours, which is equivalent to about 700 core-hours.

At Inductiva, we empower you to make smart choices for your simulation use-case.
