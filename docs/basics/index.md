## Get started
💰 Understand how credits translate into compute and storage usage, and see 
the quotas that define your resource limits. 

| **[Compute with 5$US →](/guides/basics/compute-5usd)** | **[Cloud Compute Costs →](/guides/basics/how-much-does-it-cost)** | **[Quotas →](/guides/basics/quotas)** |
|---|---|---|
| Get a concrete sense of how far the initial free credits can take you, with examples of simulations and runtimes covered by $5US. | Understand how simulation costs are calculated, including machine pricing, storage usage, and tips to stay cost-efficient. | Learn about the limits in place for each user account, how they help ensure a reliable experience for everyone, and how to request increases if needed. |


## Why it's Useful
✓ **Plan your simulation budget confidently** — Understand exactly how far your credits go and what 
affects your spending.

✓ **Choose the right resources for your needs** — Match your simulations to the most cost-efficient 
machines and core configurations. 

✓ **Avoid unexpected interruptions** — Get clarity on platform limits (quotas) to prevent your tasks 
from being blocked or delayed.

✓ **Scale responsibly** — Learn how to make the most of your available resources and when to request 
an upgrade. 

✓ **Make smarter decisions** — Transparent cost and quota info helps you optimize both performance 
and spending.
