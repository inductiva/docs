Inductiva makes it easy to export your files directly from your [Personal Remote Storage](/guides/cloud-storage/cloud-storage#personal-remote-storage) to **AWS S3**, streamlining data management and transfer.

With this integration, you can copy files directly to your AWS S3 bucket using simple commands — ideal for backing up important results, sharing large datasets, or transferring data for further analysis.
