As you run more simulations on Inductiva, storage used by failed, outdated, or large tasks can accumulate quickly, potentially [increasing costs](basics/how-much-does-it-cost) and cluttering your project space. This guide shows you how to identify and clean up unnecessary storage by:

* [Deleting failed](sections/delete-failed-tasks)
* [Deleting old tasks](sections/delete-old-tasks)
* [Cleaning up storage for entire projects](sections/delete-project-tasks)
* [Deleting unwanted/temporary files from a simulation](sections/delete-unwanted-files)
* [Downloading outputs before deletion](sections/download-and-delete)
* [Identifying tasks that use the most storage](sections/find-large-tasks)

Each section provides a code snippet to help you manage your storage effectively and keep your workspace organized.
